[h1]Notes [/h1]


If the weapons don't work, then you need to ensure you have enabled the AVF Base mod from the main mod menu.

If the tanks / vehicles vanish then it's likely because you have the performance mod or similar running, it is suggested to disable these mods if such isseus occur. 


[h1]Thanks[/h1]


Many  thanks to the following users during development

    [*] Spexta - For their fantastic work in modelling several of the vehicles in this pack
